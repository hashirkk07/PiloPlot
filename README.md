# PiloPlot
1.	Hope you have python3 installed in your system.
	Python3 is recommend for the proper functioning of this program.

	You can install Python3 from the following link:
	https://www.python.org/downloads/

2.	Next is pip3.
	If you have installed python3 successfully, congrats you already have pip3.
	If not run this: "sudo apt-get install python3-pip" in your terminal (In Unix-like systems, eg. Linux, Ubuntu..)

3.	Now you have to open Powershell or CMD (in Windows), or Terminal (in Unix-based or Mac) in the same folder PiloPlot
	which contains the piloplot.py and requirements.txt
	(in Windows, shift+right mouse click gives you the option to open Powershell or CMD)
	(in Unix-based, a simple right-click gives you the option to open the Terminal) 

	run this command in that to install the supporting packages:  
		pip3 install -r requirements.txt

4.	Next, in the same Powershell (in Windows) or same Terminal (in Unix-based or Mac) in the same folder PiloPlot
	run this command :
	In Windows (make sure the default python is not python2):  
		python.exe piloplot.py
	or  
		python piloplot.py
	(remove python2 if this does not work)
	In Linux/Mac  
		python3 piloplot.py

	Thats all! PiloPlot GUI must be infront of you now.

5.	Steps 1-3 are only for initial setup. Later, to run the tool, you only need to follow the step 4.
